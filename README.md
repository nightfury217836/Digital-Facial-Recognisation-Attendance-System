# Digital-Facial-Recognisation-Attendance-System

The Digital Facial Recognition Attendance System is an advanced, automated system designed to track and manage attendance efficiently using facial recognition technology. Unlike traditional attendance methods (manual registers or RFID cards), this system uses computer vision and AI to identify individuals in real-time, ensuring accuracy, security, and time-saving management.

# Key Features:

Facial Recognition: Utilizes AI and deep learning algorithms to detect and recognize faces in real-time. Each person is uniquely identified to prevent proxy attendance.

Automated Attendance Logging: Attendance is automatically marked when a person is recognized, eliminating manual entry errors.

Database Integration: Stores attendance records in a secure database (SQLite/MySQL), allowing easy retrieval, analysis, and reporting.

User Management: Admins can add, update, or remove users along with their facial data.

Reporting and Analytics: Generates daily, weekly, or monthly attendance reports and visual graphs for monitoring punctuality and trends.

Security and Accuracy: Advanced image processing ensures recognition even in varied lighting conditions and partial face occlusions (like masks or glasses).

GUI Dashboard: Interactive and user-friendly dashboard for admins and teachers to manage attendance and view statistics.

Optional Notifications: Can be integrated with email or SMS alerts to notify users about their attendance status.

# Applications:

Schools, colleges, and universities for student attendance.

Corporate offices for employee time tracking.

Workshops, seminars, and training programs to record participant attendance.

Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, Dlib, Face Recognition, Flask (for web interface), SQLite/MySQL

GUI: Tkinter / Web-based dashboard

Optional Integration: Email/SMS APIs for notifications

# Benefits:

Reduces manual effort and paperwork

Ensures accuracy and prevents fraudulent attendance

Provides real-time data and analytics

Scalable for institutions of any size
